# Temperature Conversion App

## Overview

The Temperature Conversion App is a cross-platform mobile application built with Flutter that provides seamless temperature conversions between Fahrenheit and Celsius scales. The application features an intuitive user interface, comprehensive input validation, persistent conversion history, and responsive design that adapts to both portrait and landscape orientations.

## Purpose

This application serves as a practical utility tool for users who need quick and accurate temperature conversions in their daily activities, whether for cooking, weather monitoring, scientific calculations, or travel planning. The app eliminates the need for manual calculations and provides a reliable conversion history for reference.

## Architecture Overview

The application follows Flutter's reactive programming paradigm and implements a clean, maintainable architecture:

### Core Architecture Pattern
- **State Management**: Utilizes Flutter's `StatefulWidget` pattern for managing application state and UI updates
- **Reactive UI**: Implements declarative UI programming where the interface automatically rebuilds when state changes occur
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component handles specific functionality (conversion logic, validation, history management)
